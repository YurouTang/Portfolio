Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


For this project I decided to create a Portfolio website for myself, to consolidate 
the things I've dabbled on in music and tech.The website is pretty simple currently, 
and I intend to add more content and features over time. 

The website consist of a main page (index.html), a page for music stuff 
(music.html), a page for tech stuff (tech.html) and a page where viewers can 
contact me by sending an email (contact.html). There are two folders within
the project, the audio folder is where I keep music recordings and the image folder
is where I keep the images rendered on the website. sass_style.css is used as the 
custom css file.
